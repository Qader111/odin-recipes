<h2 class= "desc">Description</h2>

<p class = "Para" > Waffles, crisp raised cake baked in a waffle iron, 
    a hinged metal griddle with a honeycombed or fancifully
    engraved surface that allows a thin layer of batter to cook evenly and 
    crisply. 
    In the United States and Canada, waffles are a popular breakfast food, 
    often topped with butter and maple syrup or fruit preserves. Waffles also can serve as a
    base for savoury mixtures such as seafood or poultry in sauce. In Belgium, 
    waffles are a popular snack food. They are mentioned in French poems from as 
    early as the 12th century, when they were sold as street food at fairs and religious festivals.</p>
